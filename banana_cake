Banana cake


Ingredients:

3 eggs
3 dl (1 1/4 cups) sugar
150 g butter
4.5 dl (2 cups) flour
2 teaspoons vanilla sugar
2 teaspoons baking soda ("bikarbonat" in Swedish)
8 tablespoons buttermilk ("filmj√∂llk")
3 bananas, preferably slightly brown


Preparation:

Preheat the oven to 190 C (375 F).  Melt the butter.  Mix everything
in a bowl, except for the bananas.  I prefer mixing things in the
order listed above.  Mash the bananas and add them to the mix.  Pour
into greased pan.  I use a circular pan with a hole in the middle.
Bake for about 50 minutes.  I really don't watch the time, but look at
the cake to see when it's finished.  The top should be a deep brown
color.  Do the usual tests to ensure that the cake is well baked
inside.  If you want a crunchier crust, increase the heat during the
last 10 minutes.

Let the cake cool down before eating.  It tastes better that way.  I
usually leave the cake on the table and eat a few pieces each day.
It's naturally moist enough not to go all dry.
